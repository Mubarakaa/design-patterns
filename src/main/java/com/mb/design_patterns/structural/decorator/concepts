#concepts
called wrapper
add behavior without affecting others
more than just inheritance
single responsibility principle
compose behavior dynamically
example : java.io.InputStream , UIComponents


#design
inheritance based
uses composition and inheritance (is-a, has-a)
alternative to subclassing


#pitfalls
new class for every feature
multiple little objects
complex for clients


good pattern if you dont want to modify base object
